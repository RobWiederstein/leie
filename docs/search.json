    "text": "4.1 The LEIE database\n“LEIE” is an acronym for the List of Excluded Individuals and Entitities. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Office of Inspector General (OIG) maintain the list. The list includes individuals and entities who cannot be reimbursed from Medicare because of previous misconduct. “Medicare is a U.S. government program that provides healthcare insurance and financial support for the elderly population, ages 65 and older, and other select groups of beneficiaries.”[2] Examples of misconduct include a felony drug conviction or the fraudulent submission of a Medicare claim. Additionally, the employment of an individual or entity on the LEIE may expose the employer or contractor to civil monetary penalties (CMP).\nThe exclusion list is the result of series of Congressional initiatives to reduce healthcare fraud. “In 1977, in the Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments . . . Congress first mandated the exclusion of physicians and other practitioners convicted of program-related crimes from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.”[14]\nThen in 1981, it was followed “with enactment of the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (CMPL) to further address health care fraud and abuse.The CMPL authorizes the Department and OIG to impose CMPs, assessments, and program exclusions against any person that submits false or fraudulent or certain other types of improper claims for Medicare or Medicaid payment.”[14] Beginning in 1996, the enactment of the “Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) . . . and the Balanced Budget Act (BBA)” in 1997 expanded OIG’s sanctioning authority. These statutes expanded OIG exclusion authority to all “Federal health care programs.”[14]\n“The effect of an OIG exclusion is that no Federal health care program payment may be made for any items or services furnished (1) by an excluded person or (2) at the medical direction or on the prescription of an excluded person.8 The exclusion and the payment prohibition continue to apply to an individual even if he or she changes from one health care profession to another while excluded.”[14] Employers have an ongoing obligation to know whether their employees or contractors are on the LEIE. Since the OIG updates the LEIE monthly, 2013 guidance suggested that a monthly check would minimize the probability of a violation. CMS in 2011 issued final regulations requiring states screen all enrolled providers monthly.[14]\nThe list is not comprehensive because many who commit fraud are not included. “For example, providers who are accused of overcharging insurers or Medicare often relinquish the overpayments without any public acknowledgement or notice.” [15] The LEIE is used in many machine learning efforts to label the data and identify fraud or no fraud. [2], [15] As of the date of download, August 11, 2023, the LEIE dataset included 77,942 individuals who have been excluded from participating in Medicare. Two other sanctions databases are sometimes mentioned in connection with the LEIE: the National Practitioner Databank (NPDB) and the Healthcare Integrity and and Protection Databank (HIPDB). The HIPDB data was subsumed by the NPDB in 2013.[16].\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Unique Identifiers for the Excluded\nThe list provides basic identifiers for those who are excluded from participating in Medicare. The information includes, name, last location, and date of birth. However, social security numbers are omitted in deference to prevailing federal law. For providers, they may be identified by either the National Provider Identifier (NPI) or the Unique Provider Identifier (UPIN).\nAccording to the LEIE website, “the NPI (National Provider Identifier) has replaced the UPIN as the unique number used to identify health care providers. The Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services first began assigning NPIs in 2006, and providers were required to use NPIs as of mid-2008. See page.\nAccording to the LEIE website, “the UPIN (Unique Physician Identification Number) was established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services as a unique provider identifier in lieu of the SSN. UPINs were assigned to physicians as well as certain non-physician practitioners and medical group practices. CMS no longer maintains the UPIN registry.\n“Many individuals and entities that are excluded by OIG do not have NPIs to include in the LEIE. For those individuals and entities that have NPIs, OIG has added that information to records starting in 2008 and has included NPIs in the LEIE since that time.”\n\n\n4.1.2 Missing NPIs\nParticipants who can be identified by an NPI have been increasing since their adoption in 2009. While the overall rate is 8.7%, 25% of newly added individuals and entities have an NPI included. This significantly improves the quality and usability of the database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Statutory Exclusions\nInclude count within table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    statute \n    agency \n    exclusion \n    description \n    n_count \n  \n \n\n  \n    1128b4 \n    Social Security \n    Permissive \n    License revocation or suspension \n    31084 \n  \n  \n    1128a1 \n    Social Security \n    Mandatory \n    Conviction of program related crimes \n    23109 \n  \n  \n    1128a2 \n    Social Security \n    Mandatory \n    Conviction for patient abuse \n    7449 \n  \n  \n    1128a3 \n    Social Security \n    Mandatory \n    Felony conviction for healthcare fraud \n    4987 \n  \n  \n    1128a4 \n    Social Security \n    Mandatory \n    Felony conviction for controlled substance \n    3140 \n  \n  \n    1128b14 \n    Social Security \n    Permissive \n    Default on student loans or scholarships \n    2227 \n  \n  \n    1128b8 \n    Social Security \n    Permissive \n    Entities controlled by sanctioned individual \n    1494 \n  \n  \n    1128b1 \n    Social Security \n    Permissive \n    Conviction for misdemeanor fraud \n    861 \n  \n  \n    1128b5 \n    Social Security \n    Permissive \n    Suspension under federal or state health care program \n    802 \n  \n  \n    1128b7 \n    Social Security \n    Permissive \n    Fraud or kickbacks or other prohibited \n    683 \n  \n  \n    1128b3 \n    Social Security \n    Permissive \n    Conviction for misdemeanor controlled substance \n    316 \n  \n  \n    1128b6 \n    Social Security \n    Permissive \n    Claim for excessive charges \n    67 \n  \n  \n    1128b2 \n    Social Security \n    Permissive \n    Conviction for obstruction of an investigation \n    59 \n  \n  \n    1156 \n    Social Security \n    unknown \n    Services are not economical & medically necessary \n    56 \n  \n  \n    1128b15 \n    Social Security \n    Permissive \n    Individuals controlled by a sanctioned entity \n    34 \n  \n  \n    1128b11 \n    Social Security \n    Permissive \n    Failure to supply payment information \n    11 \n  \n  \n    1128b16 \n    Social Security \n    Permissive \n    Making a false statement of material fact \n    2 \n  \n  \n    1128b12 \n    Social Security \n    Permissive \n    Failure to grant immediate access \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Previous Uses of the LEIE dataset\n\nHerland 2020\n\nHerland retained only physicians with mandatory exclusions under section 1128. “The LEIE database does not include NPI numbers for all physicians and after preliminary analysis, we found that combining first name, last name, and address is not 100% reliable in determining identity.” Only physicians with NPI numbers that matched in the Part B data to the LEIE database were used. 1,310 physicians were deemed fraudulent.\n\n\n4.1.5 Mandatory vs. Permissive Exclusions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.6 Average Monthly Exclusions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.7 Exclusions by Statory Provision\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.8 Variable Importance\nA random forest model was applied to the LEIE data to check for variable importance. An outcome variable was constucted that was “present” for an observation that contained either an NPI or UPIN number or “absent” for an observation that contained neither. Multiple variables were dropped like first name, middle name, last name, street address, the npi and npi columns. The most important variable was the date of the exclusion. Since the presence of the npi has been increasing over time, the results matched expectations. See Table 1."
